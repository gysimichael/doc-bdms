|todo| In the :doc:`data editing section <data_editing>` a new borehole was created and finally submitted.
In this section we'll see how to use the validation process tools to complete the quality control process and publish the data.

1. Data rejection
------------------

To validate or reject the data of a borehole, you have to start the editing. After entering your comments / remarks you can accept or reject the data.
Fields can be easily references using the @ character.

2. Data modification and re-submission
---------------------------------------

Now the editor can see the remarks that led to the rejection. Referenced fields in the remarks are highlighted in red so that can be quickly identified and misunderstandings are limited.

.. note::
    - *Orange* color indicates current data status
    - *Red* color indicates a status were data was rejected
    - *Green* color indicate a successfully passed status

3. Data publication
--------------------

After going trough all the validation process the borehole data are in the *Publish* stage. You, as administrator can now take a look at the validation comments history (arrow 1) and decide whether accept data but keep closed (arrow 2) or make data publicly available (arrow 3).

Select the *Submit* button. You see that all the data states are now green and that a Visbility appear with a switch button to make data visible (public) or hidden (private). Note that if data are accepted but kept closed, they can always be made public in a later stage.
