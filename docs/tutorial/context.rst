Preamble
============

The shallow underground is of primary importance in governing and planning the territories where we live.
In fact, the uppermost 500 meters below the ground surface are interested by a growing number of anthropic 
activities like constructions, extraction of drinking water, mineral resources, installation of geothermal probes, etc.

Borehole data are therefore essential as they reveal at specific location the vertical sequence of geological layers which 
in turns can provide an understanding the geological conditions we can expect in the shallow underground.

Unfortunately, data are rarely available in a FAIR way that as the acronym specify are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable
(for more information on FAIR data check the following link: https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples).

Most of the time data, particularly those collected in the past, are in the form of **static data reports** 
that describe the stratigraphy and the related characteristics; these data types are generally available as 
paper documents, or static files like .pdf of images (.ai). While very informative, these documents are not searchable, 
not interoperable nor easily reusable, since they require a non negligible time for data integration.

Sometime, **data are archived into database**. This certainly improve the find-ability of the data and its accessibility
but still do not address the interoperability requirement and therefore, combining data from different sources remain
a problematic task.

To enable FAIR borehole data and facilitate the different entities (public or private) management swisstopo (www.swisstopo.ch)
has funded the development of this application that adopt the **borehole data model** 
(BDM_) implemented by the Swiss Geological Survey. Among the benefits of adopting a standard model we can identify:

* Enhance the exchange, the usage and quality of the data
* Reach data harmonization:
    - level of detail
    - precise definitions
    - relationships and dependencies among the data
* Establish a common language between stakeholders
